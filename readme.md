#Lidar Scan Manipulation and Measurement
This repository contains scripts for manipulating and measuring lidar scans of fire lab experiments. 

##Which program should I use?
I want to...
- find the volume and height distribution of a fuelbed: rind_fuel_volume_and_height_distriburion.r
- crop a single scan to include only the platform and fuel bed: crop_scans.r
- crop a whole folder of scans to include only the platform and fuel bed: crop_all.r
